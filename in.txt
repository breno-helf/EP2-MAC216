A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,

Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Dont pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

I hear the clock aticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Ive loved you from the moment I saw you,
You looked at me all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog

Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time

You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed

Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And what youve got means such a lot to me

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.

Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,

Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.

The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...




A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.

And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone

You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry

Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged

But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Her Majestys a pretty nice girl,

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

That before too long Id fall in love with her.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.

Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know OblaDiBlaDa
But can you show me, where you are?..

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.

Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.

Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?

Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.

style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright

A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.

And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself



Because

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high......aaaaaaaahhhh

Love is all, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh....

For the benefit of Mr. Kite

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.

All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!



Glass onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.
I told you about the walrus and meman
You know that were as close as can beman
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.



Golden slumbers

Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

Then wed lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and shes loving me
She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine



Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

[Oh, rock on George, for Ringo one time.]



Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Before Im dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.
But now you got a boyfriend down the street,
Baby what youre tryin to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight

Come and keep your comrade warm.

You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!



Glass onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

You know that were as close as can beman
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I love her and shes loving me
She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand.

Oh please, say to me
Youll let me be your man
And please, say to me
Youll let me hold your hand.
Now let me hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand.

And when I touch you I feel happy inside.
Its such a feeling that my love
I cant hide, I cant hide, I cant hide.

Yeah, youve got that something,
I think youll understand.
When Ill say that something
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand,

And when I touch you I feel happy inside.

I cant hide, I cant hide, I cant hide.

Yeh, youve got that something,
I think youll understand.
When Ill feel that something
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand



I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time



I want you (shes so heavy)

I want you
so bad
its driving me mad

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, oh ho,
Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.



Ill cry instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.



Ill follow the sun

One day youll look to see Ive gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Some day youll know I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Yes, tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.



Ill get you

Oh yeh, oh yeh.
Imagine, Im in love with you,

Many, many, many times before.

But Ill get you in the end,

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed

Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

The music will never s
Roll over Beethoven

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

But youll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle.

The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
Youre going to shout aloud
Creme tangerine.

You know that what you eat you are,
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know OblaDiBlaDa
But can you show me, where you are?..

A coffee dessertyes you know its good news
But youll have to have them all pulled out

She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all.

The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know.

Sexy Sadie youll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are

We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie shes the latest and the greatest of them all.

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie.

However big you think you are

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Dont pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

I hear the clock aticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged

All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

And I will sing a lullabye

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way

She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

[Oh, rock on George, for Ringo one time.]



Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I wonder what went wrong Ive waited far too long,
I think Ill take a walk and look for her.

Though tonight shes made me sad,
I still love her,
If I find her Ill be glad,
I still love her.

I dont want to spoil the party so Ill go,
I would hate my disappointment to show,
Theres nothing for me here so I will disappear,
If she turns up while Im gone please let me know.

Though tonight shes made me sad,
I still love her,
If I find her Ill be glad,
I still love her.

Ive had a drink or two and I dont care,
Theres no fun in what I do if shes not there,
I wonder what went wrong Ive waited far too long,
I think Ill take a walk and look for her.

That before too long Id fall in love with her.
She wouldnt dance with another (whooh)

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time



I want you (shes so heavy)

I want you
so bad
its driving me mad

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.

Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh

Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.

Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

I turn around  its past
You dont time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before Im dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Matchbox

I said Im sittin here watchin
Matchbox hole in my clothes.
I said Im sittin here watchin
Matchbox hole in my clothes.

Im an ol poor boy, and Im a

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home

Honey disconnect the phone

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Dont pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

I hear the clock aticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

You looked at me all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Your mothers waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Smiles awake you when you rise

And I will sing a lullabye

Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

I want to tell her that I love her a lot

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right
Its all right



Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

But it never really mattered

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

So come on, come on, come on.

Love me while you can
Before Im dead old man

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

For the benefit of Mr. Kite

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Cooking breakfast for the queen

For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Make your mother sigh.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry

Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.

But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.

Get back, get back.

Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back to where you once belonged.

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you

I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed

Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,

And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.

Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.

One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.

Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,

Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king

Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol

Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.

The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

Would you stand up and walk out on me.

And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.
I told you about the walrus and meman
You know that were as close as can beman
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.



Golden slumbers

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

Then wed lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and shes loving me
She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine



Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

That before too long Id fall in love with her.

My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you

I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman
Wait, wait mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.

Baby what youre tryin to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me



Anna (go to him)

You say he loves you more than me,
So I will set you free,

That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo,

All of my life,
Ive been searchin for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now.. But every girl Ive ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves my sad.

Just one more thing, girl.
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.

Chorus

Shes sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do.
And so Im telling you, This time youd better s.
For I have got another girl. Another girl.
Who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend.
I dont want to say that Ive been unhappy with you,

I aint no fool and I dont take what I dont want,
For I have got another girl. Another girl.

Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend.

Ask me why

I love you, cause you tell me things I want to know.
And its true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Now youre mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, youll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
Its not because Im sad, but youre the only love that Ive ever had.

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta
Your mothers waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!



Glass onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

You know that were as close as can beman
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand



I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time



I want you (shes so heavy)

I want you
so bad
its driving me mad

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, oh ho,
Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.



Ill cry instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.



Ill follow the sun

One day youll look to see Ive gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Some day youll know I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Yes, tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.



Ill get you

Oh yeh, oh yeh.
Imagine, Im in love with you,
Its easy cos I know,
Ive imagined, Im in love with you,
Many, many, many times before.

Its not like me to pretend,
But Ill get you in the end,
Yes I will, Ill get you in the end, oh yeh, oh yeh.

I think about you night and day,
I need you cos its true.
When I think about you, I can say,
Im never, never, never, never blue.

So Im telling you, my friend,
That Ill get you, Ill get you in the end,
Yes I will, Ill get you in the end, oh yeh, oh yeh.

Well, theres gonna be a time,
Well Im gonna change your mind.
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeh.

Imagine, Im in love with you,
Its easy cos I know,
Ive imagined, Im in love with you,
Many, many, many times before.

not like me to pretend,
But Ill get you, Ill get you in the end,
Yes I will, Ill get you in the end,
Oh yeh, oh yeh.



Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Before Im dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.
But now you got a boyfriend down the street,
Baby what youre tryin to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Bbbbb! if you want our love to last.

Well you know that I love you, tell the world I do.

The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

To love me like I love you.

You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Gee its good to be back home

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

For the benefit of Mr. Kite

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door

Does it mean you dont love me any more.

On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.

Get back Loretta. Go home

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way

She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

And I do appreciate you being round.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

When I saw her standin there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long Id fall in love with her.
She wouldnt dance with another (whooh)
When I saw her standin there.

Well, my heart went boom,
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now Ill never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time



I want you (shes so heavy)

I want you
so bad
its driving me mad

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.

Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.



Ill cry instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Matchbox

I said Im sittin here watchin
Matchbox hole in my clothes.
I said Im sittin here watchin
Matchbox hole in my clothes.

Im an ol poor boy, and Im a

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright

A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.

I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.

How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Gee its good to be back home

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Dont pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

I hear the clock aticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Ive loved you from the moment I saw you,
You looked at me all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way

Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

And I do appreciate you being round.

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right
Its all right




Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

Sunday morning you dont look right.
Youve been out painting the town,

[Oh, rock on George, for Ringo one time.]



Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia

Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Baby take a chance with me.

When youre by my side,

So come on, come on, come on.

Before Im dead old man

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.



Please mister postman

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman
Wait, wait mister postman
Mister postman look and see

Since I heard from that girl of mine

From my girlfriend so far away
Please mister postman look and see

See the tear standing in my eye
You didnt s to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.

I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home

Honey disconnect the phone

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Cooking breakfast for the queen

Playing piano for the children of the king.

Picking flowers for a friend who came to play

Painting pictures for the childrens holiday.

With a message at the local bird and bee.

For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh.

Shes old enough to know better

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

You looked at me all you had to do,

Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Your mothers waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these daya are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh.

Her Majesty

Her Majestys a pretty nice girl,

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right
Its all right



Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

That before too long Id fall in love with her.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]

If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,

Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.

Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else

Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.

Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,

Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?

Treat me like you did the night before,

In the good and bad books that I have read

Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.

Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.

The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.

And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself



Because

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high......aaaaaaaahhhh

Love is all, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh....



Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

Into the light of the dark black night.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Free as a bird.

That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

Then wed lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and shes loving me
She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine



Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

That before too long Id fall in love with her.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.



Im just happy to dance with you

Before this dance is through
I think Ill love you too
Im so happy when you dance with me
I dont want or need to hold your hand
Well its only try and understand
cause theres really nothing I would rather do
cause Im happy just to dance with you

I dont need to kiss or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world theres nothing I would rather do
cause Im happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Its everything I need

Before this dance is through
I think Ill love you too
Im so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place

In this world theres nothing I would rather do
cause Im happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Its everything I need

Before this dance is through

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,

Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.



Please mister postman

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman
Wait, wait mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.

Baby what youre tryin to do?

Baby, now youre movin way too fast.

The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Ask me why

I love you, cause you tell me things I want to know.
And its true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Now youre mine, my happiness still makes me cry.

If I cry,
Its not because Im sad, but youre the only love that Ive ever had.

I cant believe its happened to me
I cant conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, Ill say I love you,

Back in the U.S.S.R.

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Gee its good to be back home

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta
Your mothers waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!



Glass onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well heres another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

You know that were as close as can beman
Well heres another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye



Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I love her and shes loving me
She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, oh ho,
Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.



Ill cry instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.



Ill follow the sun

One day youll look to see Ive gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Some day youll know I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
Yes, tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend,
In the end youll know, oooh.
One day youll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so Ill follow the sun.



Ill get you

Oh yeh, oh yeh.
Imagine, Im in love with you,

Many, many, many times before.

But Ill get you in the end,
Yes I will, Ill get you in the end, oh yeh, oh yeh.

Oh yeh, oh yeh.



Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

When it becomes too much
Youre going to shout aloud

But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know OblaDiBlaDa
But can you show me, where you are?..

But I thought that you might like to know,
That the singers going to sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along.
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.



She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me



She loves you

And you know that cant be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol

Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that youve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you dont get me, you dont get me

You say youve seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you cant see me, you cant see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!

And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

People tell me Im lucky.

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.

Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way

She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majestys a pretty nice girl
Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

And the way she looked was way beyond compare.

When I saw her standin there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long Id fall in love with her.
She wouldnt dance with another (whooh)
When I saw her standin there.

Well, my heart went boom,
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now Ill never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

Too. You love me too, you love me too.

And please, say to me
Youll let me hold your hand.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time



I want you (shes so heavy)

I want you
so bad
its driving me mad

Shes so heavy



I will

Who knows how long Ive loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me toI will.

For if I ever saw you
I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.



Ill be back

You know if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back
Again, cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh Im the one who wants you, yes, Im the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but Ive got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that Im not trying to pretend.
I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, oh ho,
Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart Ill go, but Ill be back again.



Ill cry instead

Ive got every reason on earth to be mad, cause Ive just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, Id get
Myself locked up today, but I cant so I cry instead.
Ive got a chip on my shoulder thats bigger than my feet, I
Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.
Dont want to cry when theres people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.
And when I do youd better hide all the girls, Im gonna
Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same



Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Theres people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Matchbox

I said Im sittin here watchin
Matchbox hole in my clothes.

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

But what is sweet now, turns so sour

But can you show me, where you are?..

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.

Baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because youre on your own)

Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes Im certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I cant tell you, but I know its mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,

With a little help from my friends.



A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Gee its good to be back home

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout

Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Dont bother me

Since shes been gone I want no one to talk to me.
Its not the same but Im to blame, its plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, dont bother me.

I cant believe that she would leave me on my own.
Its just not right when every night Im all alone.

Ive got no time for you right now, dont bother me.

I know Ill never be the same if I dont get her back again.
Because I know shell always be the only girl for me.

But till shes here please dont come near, just stay away.
Ill let you know when shes come home. Until that day,

Dont come around, leave me alone, dont bother me.

I guess nobody ever really done me,
oo, she done me, she done me good.

Dont let me down, dont let me down.
Dont let me down, dont let me down.



Dont pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they dont arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I dont hear it
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

I hear the clock aticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands amoving
But Im by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why Im by myself
I dont see you
Does it mean you dont love me any more.

Dont pass me by dont make me cry dont make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
Youll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Dont pass me by dont make me cry

Im sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said thats alright Im waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Ive loved you from the moment I saw you,
You looked at me all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Your mothers waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shoreyeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meetyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well heres another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
Ive got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
Im in love and its a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

She feels good, she knows shes looking fine
Im so proud to know that she is mine.

Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been
Nothing to do its up to you
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town
Everybody knows theres nothing doing
Everything is closed its like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And youre on your own youre in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed its still the same
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round its five oclock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...



Good night

Now its time to say good night
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight

Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and Ill close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.



Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

And I do appreciate you being round.

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right
Its all right



Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

[Oh, rock on George, for Ringo one time.]



Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time, Ive got time, Ive got time

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
Id try to make you sad somehow, but I cant so I cry instead.

They start to stare, Im gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But Ill come back again someday.

Break their hearts all round the world. Yes, Im gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then Ill cry instead.

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be



Im down

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed

Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

A new one cant be bought
And what youve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Natures son.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.



Nowhere man

Hes a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Hes as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,

You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,
Ow! if you want our love to last.



Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.



The word

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the word and youll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
Its the word Im thinking of
And the only word is love
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

Say the word and youll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine
Its the word, love



There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Its been a hard days night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...



A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends

Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Look in my direction, Ill be round, Ill be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, Ill be round, Ill be round

You tell me that youve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you cant hear me, you cant hear me

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC

On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home

Honey disconnect the phone

They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

For the benefit of Mr. Kite

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king.

Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry.

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the childrens holiday.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry.

The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry.

At twelve oclock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh.

Shes old enough to know better
Cry baby cry
cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
Shes old enough to know better
So cry baby cry.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!



For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Ive loved you from the moment I saw you,
You looked at me all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.



Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, 
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.

Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get on home Loretta
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.



Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!

Trying to make a dovetail jointyeah
Looking through a glass onion.

Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
Its time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that Im here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
Ive got nothing to say but its O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Dream sweet dreams for you.

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didnt run, you didnt lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say well be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When Im with you I want to stay there
If Im true Ill never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride,
I didnt know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...



Happiness is a warm gun

Shes not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
Shes well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix cause Im going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause Im going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybodys help in any way.
But now these days are gone, Im not so self assured,
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like Ive never done before.

Help me if you can, Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Wont you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

Her Majesty

Her Majestys a pretty nice girl,

Someday Im going to make her mine, oh yeh,

Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right

Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since its been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say its all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since its been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say its all right
Its all right



Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesnt know hes there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

I want her everywhere and if shes beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping Im always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere



Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You dont know what its like to listen to your fears

Childlike
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think youre something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you havent got a clue

You can talk to me, if youre lonely you can talk to me



Hey Jude

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, dont be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Dont carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, dont let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And dont you know that its just you, hey Jude, youll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, dont make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then youll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now shes hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what Id say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
Im in love but Im lazy
So wont you please come home.

I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When youre here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
Its all right
Ill make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
Its only me, its not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I dont know why,
I dont mind
I could wait forever, Ive got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe youd understand

I didnt catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever were together
Love you when were apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.

Cant talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,

Im a loser

Im a loser
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so its true, pride comes before a fall
Im telling you so that you wont lose all

Im a loser
And I lost someone whos near to me
Im a loser
And Im not what I appear to be

You telling lies thinking I cant see
You dont cry cos youre laughing at me

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday

Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Were all alone and theres nobody else
You still moan: Keep your hands to yourself!
Im down (Im really down)
Im down (Down on the ground)
Im down (Im really down)
How can you laugh when you know Im down
(How can you laugh) When you know Im down.

Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down on the ground (Im really down)
Dont you know that Im down (Im really down)
Down, down, down.

Im looking through you

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words arent clear
You dont sound differnt, Ive learned the game.
Im looking through you, youre not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Youre thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is youre down there
Im looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Im looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You dont look different, but you have changed

Im only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping

Everybody seems to think Im lazy
I dont mind, I think theyre crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find theres no need (theres no need)

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, dont spoil my day, Im miles away
And after all Im only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, Im still yawning
When Im in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, dont wake me, no, dont shake me
Leave me where I am  Im only sleeping



Im so tired

Im so tired, I havent slept a wink
Im so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

Im so tired I dont know what to do
Im so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what youd do

Youd say Im putting you on
But its no joke, its doing me harm
You know I cant sleep, I cant s my brain
You know its three weeks, Im going insane
You know Id give you everything Ive got
for a little peace of mind

Im so tired, Im feeling so upset
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.



Ive got a feeling

Ive got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ive got a feeling, a feeling I cant hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah Ive got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, Id hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I wont be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah Ive got a feeling yeah.

All these years Ive been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Evrybody had a hard year
Evrybody had a good time
Evrybody had a wet dream,
Evrybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Evrybody had a good year,
Evrybody let their hair down,
Evrybody pulled their socks up,
Evrybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]



Ive just seen a face

Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And Id have never been aware.
But as it is Ill dream of her
Tonight, didididindi.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, Ive been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, dadandadanda.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Ive just seen a face,
I cant forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
Shes just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
Weve met, mmmmmmmmmdadada.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.



If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
cause Ive been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Dont run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Dont hurt my pride like her
cause I couldnt stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you



If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
Youre the one that Id be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess Id be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
It might not have been like this
But you see now Im too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah



In my life

There are places Ill remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life Ive loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know Ill never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know Ill often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more



It wont be long

Evry night when evrybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
It wont be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Evry day Ive done nothing but cry.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me Im so alone,
Now youre coming, youre coming home,
Ill be good like I know I should,
Youre coming home, youre coming home.

Evry day well be happy, I know,
Now I know that you wont leave me no more.
It wont be long yeh, yeh.



Its all too much

Its all too much, Its all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where youd like to be

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around here
All the worlds a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that Im free
Show me that Im everywhere, and get me home for tea

Its all to much for me to see
A love thats shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

Its all too much for me to take
The love thats shining all around you
Everywhere, its what you make
For us to take, its all too much

Its too much.....Its too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)



Its only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when Im beside you?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all,
But its so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Evry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Havent I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its so hard loving you  loving you.



Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia



Komm, gib mir deine Hand

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .



Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didnt come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.



Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Who screw you in the ground
Theyll fill your head with all the things you see

Ill make love to you
If you want me too



Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.



Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And shes gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And youre gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.



Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwells silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testtube
Ohhohohoh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joaoaoaoan?”
But as shes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be sooooo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. ThirtyOne said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohhohohoh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them sooooo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwells silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead



Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, shes a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that hes ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother natures son

Born a poor young country boyMother Natures son
All day long Im sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain streamsee her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grassMother Natures son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasnt you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you Id realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And Ill forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Ive tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
Thats a lie,
cause I know where youve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,

No reply, no reply.



Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isnt it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “Its time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isnt it good, norwegian wood.



Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wondring why,
I cried for you.

And now, youve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, its through, oh.

Oh, youre giving me the same old line,
Im wondring why,
You hurt me then, youre back again,
No, no, not a second time.

Nowhere Man, please listen,
You dont know what youre missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesnt kave a point of view,
Knows not where hes going to,
Isnt he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, dont worry,
Take your time, dont hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

Hes a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans



Obladi, oblada

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Mollygirl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening shes a singer with the band.

And if you want some funtake Obladi Oblada.



Ocuss garden

Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade
Hed let us in, knows where weve been
In his ocus garden in the shade

Id ask my friends to come and see
An ocus garden with me
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we cant be found
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
(Happy and theyre safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Id like to be under the sea
In an ocus garden with you.



Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Dont ever leave me alone

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
Ill never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm

When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didnt need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
Ill never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
Ill never do you no harm



Old brown shoe

I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now, Im telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.

If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you cant reject.
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something Id hate.
Ill make an early start, Im making sure that Im not late.
For you sweet  lip Im in the queue, baby, Im in love with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same now when Im with you.



One after 909

My baby says shes travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
Youre only fooling around, youre fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said Im travling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says youve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find Ive got the number wrong

Well I said Im travling on the one after 909
I said move over honey Im travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby dont be cold as ice.

I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 9 0,
I said were travling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]



Only a northern song

If youre listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But theyre not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
When youre listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As its only a Northern song.
It doesnt really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When its only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
Youre correct, theres nobody there.
It doesnt really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you theres no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head hes had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
Its a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho she feels as if shes in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.



Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They dont care what goes on around
In their eyes theres something lacking
What they needs a damn good whacking.

Everywhere theres lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
Shes so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
Shes killerdiller when shes dressed to the hilt
Shes the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.



Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everythings the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I dont mind.
Shine, the weathers fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
Its just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Dont need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

Its real love
Its real, yes its real love
Its real

Thought Id been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Dont need to be alone
No need to be alone

Its real love
Yes its real, yes its real love
Its real, yes its real love...



Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that its evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Dont you know you can count me out
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
Wed all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
Were doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Dont you know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say youll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me its the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You aint going to make it with anyone anyhow
Dont you know know its gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!
(repeat till fade)



Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lose it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Ive got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man, they were goin like a hurricane

Thats why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinkin home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin got all shook up

And started playin that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Dont care to hear em play a tango
Im in the mood to gear a mambo
Its way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a back beat, you cant lost it,
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me



Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that
He said Im gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc its only a scratch
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideons bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rockys revival.

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said shed always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didnt anybody tell her?
Didnt anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday,
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said, she said

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And shes making me feel like Ive never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that Im mad
And youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said “you dont understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, youre wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that Im ready to leave
Cause youre making me feel like Ive never been born.”

She said I know what its like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...



Shes a woman

My love dont give me presents.
I know that shes no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love dont give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that shes only
Foolin, I know she isnt.

She dont give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She dont give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin,
Dont ask me why.

Shes a woman who understands.
Shes a woman who loves her man.

Shes a woman, shes a woman.



Shes leaving home

Wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter thats lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our babys gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
Shes leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didnt know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money cant buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye



Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freun.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.



Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, wont you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, wont you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.

Slow down, baby, now youre movin way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin, gimme little lovin,

Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I dont need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Youre asking me will my love grow
I dont know, I dont know
You stick around now it may show
I dont know, I dont know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Dont want to leave her now
You know I believe her now



Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
Its getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
it doesnt matter much to me.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you cant you know tune in but its all right,
that is I think its not too bad.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think its me, but you know I know when its a dream.
I think I know I mean a Yes but its all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, cause Im going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.



Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybodys laughing
Everybodys happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel



Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
Theres one for you, nineteen for me
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I dont take it all
Cause Im the taxman, yeah Im the taxman

If you drive a car, Ill tax the street,
If you try to sit, Ill tax your seat.
If you get too cold Ill tax the heat,
If you take a walk, Ill tax your feet.

Dont ask me what I want it for
If you dont want to pay some more
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause Im the taxman, yeah, Im the taxman
And youre working for no one but me.



Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if Im part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me Ill make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Dont you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Cant you try to see that Im trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.



Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you evrything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If theres something I have said or done,
Tell me what and Ill apologize,
If you dont really cant go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If youll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
cause I really cant stand it, Im so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.



Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
Thats the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
Youve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally Ill always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.



The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “Youve got to turn back”.
You know they didnt even give us a chance.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “Were only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when youre dead
You dont take nothing with you
But your soul  think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “Shes gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
Its good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it aint easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.
The way things are going
Theyre going to crucify me.



The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
Hes the all American bulletheaded saxon mothers son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?



The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.



The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that hes just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .



The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing



The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
Ive seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times Ive been alone and many times Ive cried
Anyway youll never know the many ways Ive tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Dont leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da



The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?

Treat me like you did the night before,

Have you heard the word is love?
Its so fine, Its sunshine

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now Ive got it, the word is good

Spread the work Im thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

Its the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way

Now that I know what I feel must be right
Im here to show everybody the light

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind theres no sorrow,
Dont you know that its so.
Therell be no sad tomorrow,
Dont you know that its so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And its my mind,
And theres no time when Im alone.

Theres a place...



Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
Youll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when Im lonely,
Wishing you werent so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say youll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, Im just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And thats enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.

Well go on and on.
Someday when were dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.



style=color:black;msoansilanguage:ENUS>Think for yourself

Ive got a word or two To say about the things that you do
Youre telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still cant see
I know your minds made up
Youre gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Although your minds opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And youve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where youre going to
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you
Think for yourself
Cause I wont be there with you


A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

Id love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Id love to turn you on



A hard days night

Its been a hard das night, and I been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say youre going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When Im home everything seems to be right
When Im home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

But when I get home to you Ill find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and Ill sing you a song,
And Ill try not to sing out of key.

I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.

A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, though were far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
Ill come back (hell come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.



Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothings gonna change my world,
Nothings gonna change my world.

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didnt get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee its good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgias always on my mind.

Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddys farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
Im back in the U.S.S.R.
You dont know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.



Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He wont do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He dont want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girls hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night shes ready to poop
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mothers Laundromat
Well, mamas head has got to s
Juniors head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself



Because

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high......aaaaaaaahhhh

Love is all, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh....



Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring dont be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets hell undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is ping the bill.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

About an hour or two

Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when theres nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?



Every little thing

People tell me Im lucky.

There is one thing Im sure of,
I will love her forever.
For I know love will never die.
Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah.
And you know the things she does,

Everybodys got something to hide except me and my monkey

Come on come on come on come on
Come on is such a joy
Come on is such a joy
Come on take it easy

Everybodys got something to hide except for me and

Everybodys trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybodys trying to be my baby, everybodys trying to be my baby,
Everybodys trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didnt stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.



Fixing a hole

Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
Im filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesnt matter if Im wrong
Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they dont get in my door.
Im painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesnt matter if
Im wrong Im right
Where I belong Im right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they dont get past my door.
Im taking the time for a number of things
That werent important yesterday
And I still go.
Im fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.



For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You wont forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because youre sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because youre sweet and lovely girl its true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.

Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
Its the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry

Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldnt last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.

But she was another man
All the girls around her say shes got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back.

Get back, get back.

Get back Loretta. Go home

Get back to where you once belonged.

[Thanks, Mo! ...on behalf of the group I hope we passed the audition.]



Getting better

Its getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me werent cool
Youre holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

Ive got to admit its getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
Im doing the best that I can.
Ive got to admit its getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but Im changing my scene
And Im doing the best that I can.

I admit its getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit its getting better
Its getting better since youve been mine.




Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shs looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!
